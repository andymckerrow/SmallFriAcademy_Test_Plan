    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>The intent is to make sure the website for Small Fri Academy in Salt Lake City, UT is ready to be deployed after being developed by my collegue at Helio Training, Trea Winn</p>
    <h2>Testing Environment</h2>
    <p>Testing will occur while being hosted on Netlify. Site will go live to be hosted at a as-yet unknown url by mid-October 2018. </p>
    <h2>Scope</h2>
    <p>Client asked to have all the following tested on numerous browsers, both mobile and desktop:
      <li>Functionality (links, navigation, etc.)</li>
      <li>Visual display properties, including text animations</li>
      <li>Content</li>
     Issues outside of this scope that do not crash the page will be considered intentional.</p>
    <h2>Schedule</h2>
    <p><p>Testing must be completed by 5:00 pm on September 10th 2018. Please note: This means I had just 2 days to start and complete the project, from initial contact with the client to the completion of the test cycle. My intention is to deliver as much coverage as possible in the short time allowed.</p></p>
    <h2>User Stories</h2>

    <li>As a potential client I want to use the contact form so that I can start an email conversation about enrolling my child.</li>
